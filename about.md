## About Play with Moby

Play-with-moby (PWM) is a site made by Docker captains [Marcos Nils](https://www.twitter.com/marcosnils) and [Jonathan Leibiusky](https://www.twitter.com/xetorthio) as an extension of [PWD](http://play-with-docker.com). PWM is a Moby playground which allows you to try different components of the platform in seconds. It gives you the experience of having a free Alpine Linux Virtual Machine in the cloud where you can build and run Moby projects and even create clusters to experiment. Under the hood DIND or Docker-in-Docker is used to give the effect of multiple VMs/PCs.
